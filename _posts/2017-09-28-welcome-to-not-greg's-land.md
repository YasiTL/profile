This ain't your typical Greg's land.

##### Overview of This Week
* I made this website!
* I learned how to use git
* Planned robotics meetings
* Had one hell of a Saturday meeting

TLDR; Everyhing is bad and I hate the world.
  But we aren't allowed to say stuff like that in the real world so here I am. 
  Writing this blog.
  
  Honestly for me this was an insanely productive week. But I'm slowly coming
  to the realization that I may have not thought this whole blogging
  thing out, and that I am actually way lamer than I expected.
  
  Nevertheless, I persist.
  
  I have been working tirelessly for the past 3 weeks on making
  an [RGB color space cube](https://www.github.com/yasitl/color-space). 
  The quick explanation of this is project is
  just a cube that has RGB color values plotted to each vertex. The goal
  is for this cube to be cut by a plane and show all of the colors contained
  inside of the cube. It is going to (or possibly would have been) a really
  interesting idea.
  
  I am thinking about putting this color-space project down, and find
  something better (and easier) to pursue. Don't worry. I will come back
  to it.
  
  In my english class I'm writing an essay about security vs. privacy in
  technology. I'm sure that is going to be an interesting time.
  
  The saturday robotics meeting lead to tons of accomplishments,
  programmers programmed, Greg made a holonomic robot actually work,
  we killed one of 3 prototypes... We are getting somewhere folks.
  
  Not sure how often I will be posting, or if I ever will post again.
  But I'll do my best.
  
#### What have I learned this week?
Managing a team and leading a team are two very different things. Managing,
while being challenging, can be accomplished via practice. Leading, however,
is something that not everyone can do.

#### Goals for next week:
* Get good at APUSH and Precalc
* Learn how to not be bad at robotics.
* Get a new project underway for my CS independent study or fix the old one.
* Figure life out.
