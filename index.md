# I'm Yasaman Mostafavi.

I am a high school student intrested in computer science and design.

I work on various projects in my free time in order to become better aquainted with the world of computer science.

My main focuses include Robotics, TSA (Technology Student Association), creating art and trying to become a better human.

I hope you enjoy reading about my trials and tribulations through the vast land that is computer science. Feel free to ask questions at any time via any of the links on the right. I'll do my best to respond.
